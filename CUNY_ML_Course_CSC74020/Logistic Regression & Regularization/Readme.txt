1. Tasks finished
All tasks, including PCA, polynomial transformation, logistic regression, Regularization(uniform weight decay/low-order weight decay), 5-fold cross validation, training with breast cancer data set, visualization.

2. Environment
Python 3.7.1 64-bit

3. Platform
Windows 10, VSCode, Visual Studio

4. Resources that help me
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35419882/cost-function-in-logistic-regression-gives-nan-as-a-result

5. Using
open the file in any IDE, for example, VSCode or Visual Studio, run it. 
If need to change the lambda values, change the d0, d1, ... and decays
If need to change the learning rate, epochs, batch_size, folding, give the corresponding parameter when instantiate the logistic regression object. 
If you want to try different formular version or uniform/low-order regularizers, you need to change the loss function and gradient function. Only one version code is uncommented, other versions are commented.
